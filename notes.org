* Day 1
** What is breakout
   bunch of bricks
   ball moving back and forth
   paddle bounces up
   if ball moves below a point, game over
** the canvas (ms paint)
   x,y plane with top to bot and left to right coordinates
   retangles have color and x,y, width, and height
   circles have color and x,y, radius
   Game flow: draw flow chart with start, stop, and loop (clear, update, redraw)
** canvas API
   getContext
   how to shape - fillStyle=color, beginPath(), rect(x,y,w,h), fill(), closePath()
   arc is similar to rect
   clearRect - can erase part of the board
   we'll learn more tomorrow
** Draw functions
   typing all that out is painful, so we create draw functions
